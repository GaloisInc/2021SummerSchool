# Galois 2021 Trustworthy Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science Summer School

## Trustworthy ML/AI/DS at Galois

In the summer of 2021, Galois hosted its first summer school in Trustworthy Machine Learning, AI, and Data Science.  This summer school was a one day course that focused on hands-on and project-based educational content to a global body of students.  Students in our summer program worked in small groups to tackle problems with untrustworthy data and models, and their impact on human-critical systems and results.

We've made the materials from our summer program available here for use with other programs, institutions, and with the hopes that we will grow these resources as time goes on.
